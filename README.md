This is one of my old forgotten projects. It's designed to help with github. Coded with JavaScript using NodeJS environment.

Requirements:

1. readline-sync package -> npm i readline-sync
2. child_process package -> npm i child_process
3. Github console installed. (Not Github Desktop)

To use, you may run the executable file or type node index.js.


(Take note before installing anything: The project is not maintained, and will most likely be outdated if not developed. So there can be bugs and the code might be a bit messy as I made it a quite long time ago. With that being said, hope you enjoy it!)
