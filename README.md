This is one of my old forgotten projects. It's designed to help with github. Coded with JavaScript using NodeJS environment.

Requirements:

1. readline-sync package -> npm i readline-sync
2. child_process package -> npm i child_process
3. Github console installed. (Not Github Desktop)

To use, you may run the executable file or type node index.js.
